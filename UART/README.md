Since during the simulation it is not possible to send data via Bluetooth from a physical device, it is necessary to simulate the connection of several devices via Bluetooth. To simulate the connection of two devices via UART, it is convenient
use the program "Virtual Serial Ports Emulator", with which you can create a pair of virtual ports connected to each other, thereby simulating the connection of several (in our case, two) devices via Bluetooth.
